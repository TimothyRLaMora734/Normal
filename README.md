# Normal

Normal is a screensaver for macOS 10.12+. It applies a configurable Gaussian
blur to whatever is on the screen. That's it. I wrote it in 2017 when I was
meant to be focusing on something else.

## Installation

Download the screensaver from the [releases][releases] page and double click to
install it. The screensaver is code signed with my Developer ID certificate
(verify with `spctl`) but because Normal is a bundle not an app, Gatekeeper
might complain anyway.

[releases]: https://github.com/alexjohnj/Normal/releases

Note macOS sometimes has issues with screensavers written in Swift. If you get
an error when trying to use the screensaver, reinstalling it and/or restarting a
few times should make it go away.
